# MSiD_final_project
Linear regression based project. It gathers the required data from the "San Francisco Police Department Incident Reports: 2018 to Present" dataset in an attempt to predict the time that it will take for the crime to be reported after the crime itself is committed in correlation to such variables as the area where the incident happened, the police department that was responsible for handling the case, when the incident took place and the type of crime that it is.
