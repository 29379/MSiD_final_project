# MSiD_final_project
Linear regression based project. It gathers the required data from the "San Francisco Police Department Incident Reports: 2018 to Present" dataset in an attempt to predict the time that it will take for the crime to be reported after the crime itself is committed in correlation to such variables as the resolution of the case, how it was reported, the police department that was responsible for handling it, when and where the incident took place and the type of crime that it is.
